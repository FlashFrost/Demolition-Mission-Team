# Demolition-Mission-Team-
Welcome to space! In this game you will be shooting the moon with asteroids (and comets). Normally shooting the moon is easy, but we've put planets, rebar, and anti-gravity emiters in your way so be careful to utilize and avoid these obstacles to destroy the moon! This game contains a menu with the developers, level selection, and instructions! There are buttons in the top left corner where you can restart a level or return to the main menu. Make sure you also click the zoom out button in the bottom right so you can see the rest of that level you are struggling beating!
